# Road-Accident-Dashboard
An interactive Excel dashboard analyzing UK road accident data with KPIs, visual trends, and filterable insights. 
👉 [Includes datasets, Excel dashboard, and monthly trends visualization]

## 🎯 Project Objective:
- To analyze UK road accident data for better understanding of casualty trends.
- To categorize casualties by severity: fatal, serious, and slight.
- To identify high-risk vehicle types contributing to accidents.
- To analyze the impact of road types and surface conditions on accidents.
- To compare current year (CY) and previous year (PY) monthly trends in casualties.
- To evaluate casualty distribution based on location (urban vs rural).
- To study the effect of light conditions (day vs night) on accident severity.
- To design an interactive Excel dashboard with dynamic filters for deeper insights.

## Dataset Used:
- <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R_uaoZL18nRbqC_MULVne90h3SdRbAyn/edit?gid=1319047066#gid=1319047066"> Dataset </a>

## 📌🌟 Project Highlights:
- Total casualties: 417,883 with 79.8% involving cars.
- Major casualties occurred under daylight (305K) and on single carriageways (309.7K).
- Casualty distribution by road conditions: Dry (279K), Wet (115K), Snow/Ice (22K).
- Majority accidents occurred in urban areas (255K).
- Visual trend comparison between 2021 vs 2022 casualties.

## ✅📊 KPI-Based Questions (Derived from Dashboard):
Q1) What is the total number of road accident casualties?
Q2) How many casualties were fatal, serious, or slight?
Q3) What percentage of total casualties were caused by cars?
Q4) Which type of vehicle is responsible for the highest number of casualties?
Q5) How do the monthly casualty trends compare between 2021 and 2022?
Q6) Which road type (single, dual carriageway, roundabout, etc.) has the highest casualties?
Q7) What is the distribution of casualties based on road surface conditions (dry, wet, snow/ice)?
Q8) How many casualties occurred in rural vs urban areas?
Q9) What are the casualty counts under different light conditions (daylight vs dark)?
Q10) In which quarter of the year do most accidents tend to occur?
Q11) What is the trend in casualties over time across various accident types?
Q12) What is the contribution of non-motorized users (pedestrians, cyclists) to total casualties?

## 📈🔄 Process:
1) Collected and imported UK road accident datasets.
2) Cleaned and transformed data in Excel.
3) Created pivot tables for different analysis dimensions.
4) Built dynamic charts and graphs for KPIs.
5) Designed dashboard layout with clear visuals and slicers.
6) Implemented filters for accident date and area (urban/rural).
7) Compared current year vs previous year trends.
8) Finalized an interactive and navigable dashboard for presentation.
